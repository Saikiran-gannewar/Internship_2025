    <h2 class="cold">Database Management</h2>
    <p>
        A database is essential for storing and managing application data. There are two main types of databases: SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL). SQL databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL organize data into structured tables with relationships. NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Firebase offer flexible, document-based storage, making them ideal for scalable applications. ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) like Mongoose (for MongoDB) and Sequelize (for SQL databases) simplify database interactions in back-end code.</p>
    <h3>Full-Stack Integration</h3>
    <p>
        Integrating the front-end with the back-end involves making API calls using tools like Fetch API or Axios to retrieve and send data. State management libraries like Redux and Context API in React help in efficiently managing application data. This integration allows user interactions on the front-end to reflect changes in the database through the back-end.</p>
    <h3>Authentication & Authorization</h3>
    <p>
        Security is a crucial part of web development, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain parts of an application. Authentication verifies user identity using methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and OAuth, while authorization controls access based on user roles. Implementing features like login, signup, password hashing, and session management enhances the security of web applications.</p>

    <h2>Deployment & Hosting</h2>
    <ol>
        <p>
            Once the application is complete, it needs to be deployed so that users can access it online. Front-end applications can be hosted on platforms like Netlify and Vercel, while back-end services can be deployed on Render, Railway, or AWS. Databases can also be hosted on platforms like MongoDB Atlas, Firebase, and Amazon RDS, ensuring secure data storage and access.</p>
