        <h1>Full-Stack Web Development: Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
        <p>Introduction to Full-Stack Development
            Full-stack development refers to the process of building both the front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) of a web application. A full-stack developer works with different technologies to create a complete, functional website or web application. The three main components of full-stack development are the front-end (UI/UX), the back-end (server, logic, APIs), and the database (storage and retrieval of data).</p>

        <h2>Front-End Development</h2>
        <p>
            Front-end development focuses on building the visual and interactive aspects of a website. It primarily involves HTML (for structure), CSS (for styling), and JavaScript (for interactivity). Modern front-end frameworks like React.js, Angular, and Vue.js help in creating dynamic, responsive, and modular web applications. CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap and Tailwind simplify the design process by providing pre-built styles and layouts.</p>
        <p>Version Control & Deployment
            Version control systems like Git help developers track changes in their code, collaborate with teams, and maintain different versions of their project. Platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide cloud-based repositories for storing and sharing code. Once the front-end is ready, it can be deployed using hosting services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages, allowing users to access the website online.</p>
        <h2 class="hot">Back-End Development</h2>
        <p>The back-end is responsible for processing business logic, handling database operations, and managing authentication. Common back-end technologies include Node.js with Express.js, Django with Python, Flask, and Java-based frameworks like Spring Boot. A back-end server communicates with the front-end by sending and receiving data via APIs. RESTful APIs are widely used to manage HTTP requests and responses, enabling seamless communication between different parts of the application.</p>
